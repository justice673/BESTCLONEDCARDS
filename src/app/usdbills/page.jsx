          <h2 className={styles.heading}> Counterfeit Money / USD Counterfeit Banknotes</h2>

It can also be defined as currency that is produced without the legal sanction of the state or government to resemble some official form of currency closely enough that it may be confused for genuine currency. Producing or using counterfeit money is a form of fraud or forgery, and is illegal.</p>
          <p>The business of counterfeiting money is almost as old as money itself: plated copies (known as Fourr√©es) have been found of Lydian coins, which are thought to be among the first Western coins. Before the introduction of paper money, the most prevalent method of counterfeiting involved mixing base metals with pure gold or silver. Another form of counterfeiting is the production of documents by legitimate printers in response to fraudulent instructions. Today some of the <Link href={"/"}> finest counterfeit banknotes </Link>  are called Superdollars because of their high quality and imitation of the real US dollar. There has been significant counterfeiting of USD banknotes and coins since the launch of the currency in 2002, but considerably less than that of the US dollar.</p>

An unauthorized artificial increase in the money supply; a decrease in the acceptability of paper money; and losses, when traders are not reimbursed for counterfeit money detected by banks, even if it is confiscated. Traditionally, anti-counterfeiting measures involved including fine detail with raised intaglio printing on bills which allows non-experts to easily spot forgeries. On coins, milled or reeded (marked with parallel grooves) edges are used to show that none of the valuable metal has been scraped off.</p>
        <p>The use of counterfeit currency can violate both federal and state law. A person suspected of passing fake money may be charged with one or more crimes, including forgery, fraud, or other theft-related offenses. Examples of state penalties are below.
